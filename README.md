# Effective Print Design

Print CSS that doesn't look like print CSS.

A [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that turns Claude into an InDesign operator — fluent in Bringhurst, Butterick, and Tschichold, building with pure HTML/CSS.

## The Problem

Most printed web pages look terrible. Chopped headings, orphaned lines, invisible backgrounds, raw URLs nobody will type, rivers of whitespace in justified text. Print is an afterthought — and it shows.

## What This Skill Does

Gives Claude deep knowledge of print typography, paged media, and web-to-print production. Ask for a resume, invoice, article, book, or report and get CSS that holds up at 300 DPI.

**Typography** — proper `pt` sizing, optical sizing, OpenType features, hyphenation, justified text done right, locale-correct quotation marks for 12 Western languages.

**Layout** — `@page` rules, page simulation on screen, baseline grids, fragmentation control, sidebar + main grid patterns.

**Page Features** — running headers/footers, CSS counters, crop marks, footnote-style links, table header repetition, drop caps.

## Install

```bash
claude skill add effective-print-design
```

Activates automatically when you mention `@media print`, `@page`, print stylesheets, or ask for a document that needs to look good on paper.
